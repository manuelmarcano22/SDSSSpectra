    This function implements a high-level wrapper around IRAF's mkiraf, which
    initializes the IRAF login script and the user parameters directory in the
    path given as input. Any existing login script or uparm directory is
    silently overwritten, although mkiraf makes a backup of the former by
    appending '.OLD' to its name. In this manner, the original login script
    'login.cl' becomes 'login.cl.OLD'.

    The login script that this function creates chooses 'xgterm' as its
    terminal type. It is usually the best choice, being a xterm-like terminal
    program written specifically to work with IRAF. Note that, although we are
